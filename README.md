# Learning long-range spatial dependencies with horizontal gated recurrent units

Introducing the hGRU, an approach to learning horizontal connections between computational units. This model is highly effective at capturing dependencies between visual features that span long spatial distances, with only very-deep Residual Networks and state-of-the-art models for per-pixel prediction rivaling the performance of a *single hGRU layer* on the tasks that we investigate in [our manuscript](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.08315), set to appear at Neural Information Processing Systems, 2018.
